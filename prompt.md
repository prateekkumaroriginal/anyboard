I am building "AnyBoard" which is a project that lets users define their data and where to get them, and get to see them in a dashboard.

Users can have as many dashboards as they want within tiers for a flat fee per month.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative, unique and professional. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

I want you to create five different designs each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /model /1, /2, /3, /4, /5 respectively.

Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional.
